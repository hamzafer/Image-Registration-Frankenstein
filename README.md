# Image Registration Project - "Frankenstein"

## Overview

This repository contains all the activities and code developed for an advanced image registration project named "
Frankenstein". The project explores various aspects of image processing, including transformations, feature detection,
feature matching, and comprehensive evaluations of registration quality using both intensity-based and location-based
metrics.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Activity1/`: Code and results for initial image transformations.
- `Activity2/`: Feature detection using different methods like SIFT and SURF.
- `Activity3/`: Feature matching and analysis.
- `Activity4/`: Transformation estimation and image registration.
- `Activity5/`: Evaluation of the registration method using quantitative metrics.

## Getting Started

To run any part of this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have MATLAB installed, as all scripts are written in MATLAB.
3. Navigate to the activity folder you wish to run, open the MATLAB scripts (.m files).
4. Run the scripts in MATLAB to see the results.

## Activities Overview

- **Activity 1**: Implements two image transformations: shear and rigid.
- **Activity 2**: Uses MATLAB functions to extract control points using SIFT and SURF.
- **Activity 3**: Matches features extracted in Activity 2 and analyzes the results.
- **Activity 4**: Estimates the geometric transformation needed to align images based on matched control points.
- **Activity 5**: Evaluates the quality of image registration using RMSE and control point location accuracy.
- **Additional Validation**: Tests the "Frankenstein" method on a cat image to ensure general applicability.

## Results

Detailed results are documented within each activity's folder. Key metrics such as RMSE, control point alignment, and
visual plots are available to review the effectiveness of the registration methods used.

## Contributions

This project was designed and implemented as part of an advanced course in image processing. Contributions to refining
the code or extending the analyses are welcome. Please fork this repository and submit your pull requests for review.
